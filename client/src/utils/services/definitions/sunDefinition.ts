/**
 * Defines the current sun cycle status based on the provided timestamps.
 *
 * This function calculates whether it is currently day or night, the duration of the current sun cycle (day or night),
 * and the time elapsed since the start of this cycle, based on the sunrise and sunset times, and the current time.
 *
 * @param sunRise The timestamp for sunrise in seconds.
 * @param sunSet The timestamp for sunset in seconds.
 * @param dt The current timestamp in seconds.
 * @returns An object containing:
 * - `cycleDuration`: The duration of the current cycle (day or night) in seconds.
 * - `timeSinceCycleStart`: The time elapsed since the start of the current cycle in seconds.
 * - `isDay`: A boolean indicating if it is currently day (true) or night (false).
